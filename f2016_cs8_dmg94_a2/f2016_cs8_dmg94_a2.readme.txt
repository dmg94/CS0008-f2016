Hello!
This program takes files from the user and provides them with a running total of
the distance ran by all of the participants in the file as well as how many lines (people) there
are in the file as the output by using an indefinite loop until the user puts in 'q' 'quit' or an empty
string at the end.
The program produces a table following this format:
File to be read: file_1.csv
Partial Total # of lines  : x1
Partial distance run      : y1
File to be read: file_2.csv
Partial Total # of lines  : x2
Partial distance run      : y2
     File to be read: quit
Totals
Total # of lines          : x1 + x2
Total distance run        : y1 + y2

Enjoy!
