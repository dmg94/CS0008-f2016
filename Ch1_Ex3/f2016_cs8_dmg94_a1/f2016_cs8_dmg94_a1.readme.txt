Hello!
On September 29th, 2016, I created this program called
Assignment 1 for CS0008.
This program takes user input to get the distance
and gas that he/she traveled in a car (in metric or US systems)
and then takes that information to provide them with a table of
how much gas was used, distance traveled, and how much fuel was consumed
into a nice chart.
First I used the float and input function and assigned the variable 'system' to it.
Then I used an If-else decision structure to ask for the units depending on which 'system' was chosen.
Afterwards I made the equations for the computer to solve.
Next I used the chart to make another If decision structure to assign the
'fuel' variable for the gas consumption rating.
Finally I used multiple print and format functions to make the chart.
Formatting was the most difficult part.
Also, if you want to use the Metric, press the space bar first before typing 'M'.
Lastly, I hope you enjoy the program.

Enjoy!
