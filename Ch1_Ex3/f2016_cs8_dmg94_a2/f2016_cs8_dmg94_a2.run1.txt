This is how far I've gotten with the program assignment. I was having a lot of trouble figuring out why the process_file
function wouldn't work when called and why the interpreter wouldn't have the first input phrase pop up.
I tried asking some friends I know that know Python and Google/Stackoverflow with a lot of the exceptions and
logic. It helped me out with some of the issues I had.
