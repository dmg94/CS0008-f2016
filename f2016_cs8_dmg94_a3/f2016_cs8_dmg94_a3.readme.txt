Hello!
In this program, a zip file is given to the computer (in .csv format).
After reading the files, the program will give out the following output:
The total number of participants,
The number of files read
The total number of lines read
The total distance
The total distance run for each participant
The max distance (and by whom)
The min distance (and by whom)
How many people appear more than once, the number of times that he/she appears
and their names
There will also be an output file given to the user to read called
"f2016_cs8_dmg94_a3.data.output.csv" which will have the following:
The names of the participants
The number of times that their name appears in the input files
The total distance run.

Enjoy!
