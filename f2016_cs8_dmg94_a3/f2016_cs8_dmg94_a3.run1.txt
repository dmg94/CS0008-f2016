Here is where I got in my program:
I wrote out the whole thing, but while debugging I keep running into this issue with converting the string numbers ("34" instead
of 34 for an int or 34.0 for a float, etc.)
At first it wasn't working because I learned that you can't use the float function to convert a list to a float.
Then I thought of the indexing and iterating over the list (with Alex's help) and made a variable x to
make the index increase by 2 while the for loop is iterating over the file.
