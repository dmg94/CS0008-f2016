Hello!
This is my final project for Computer Science 0008, Fall 2016.
This program takes a master file (with multiple file names inside) and loads them into memory. Each individual file contains
the names of participants and the distances that each of them ran in an experiment.
After reading the master file, the program will display the following information to the user:
Number of files read
Total number of lines read
Total distance run (by the whole population)
Total distance run (by each participant name)
The maximum distance run in the experiment and by whom
The minimum distance run in the experiment and by whom
The total number of participants that were in the experiment
Any participants that appear more than one time, will display the number of times he/she appears and their names.

In addition to this, an output file will be produced called f2016_cs8_dmg94_fp.output.csv which will be a
file with the following information:
Participant name, number of times he/she appeared in the experiment, and their total distance
with commas separating each value
Ex) Max,5,3,456.7890

In contrast to Assignment 3, this program uses a class to get all of the participant data to write to the output
and the output file.

Enjoy!
